# hashCode

`fun hashCode(): `[`Int`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-int/index.html)

Overrides [Tree.hashCode](../-tree/hash-code.md)

Returns a hash code value for the object.  The general contract of hashCode is:

* Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once, the hashCode method must consistently return the same integer, provided no information used in equals comparisons on the object is modified.
* If two objects are equal according to the equals() method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result.
